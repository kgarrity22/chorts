# Viz Gallery

A library of bespoke data visualizations created with various JS visualization tools

TODO: drop image here

## Description
This repo contains a series of data visualizations I've created, mostly with D3 and Vega. It serves as a place where I experiment with different visualization practices & interaction techniques and explore datasets I find interesting.

#### Some viz techniques explored here:
* Using SVGs as fill
* Smooth zooming on click where zoomed version shows additional level of detail
* Creating non-cartesian-plane visuals with Vega-lite
* Using SVGs for shape encodings
* Adding labels with [d3-svg-annotation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-svg-annotation)



### Built With

* [![React][React.js]][React-url]
// d3
// observable
// vega
// vega lite



## Structure

Each separate visual can be found inside of it's own directory inside of `src/visualizations` (note that a number of these are still under active development). 
* some hosted here, some hosted on observable 
* the datasets are in here as well
