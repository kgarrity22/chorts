## Description
This repo contains a series of data visualizations I've created, mostly with D3 and Vega. It serves as a place where I experiment with different visualization practices & interaction techniques and explore some interesting datasets.

#### Some viz techniques explored here:
* Using SVGs as fill
* Smooth zooming on click where zoomed version shows additional level of detail
* Creating non-cartesian-plane visuals with Vega-lite
* Using SVGs for shape encodings
* Adding labels with [d3-svg-annotation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-svg-annotation)



### Built With

## Structure

Each separate visual can be found inside of it's own directory inside of `src/visualizations` (note that a number of these are still under active development). Some of the visualizations live inside this site, while a handful are hosted on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/about). The corresponding datasets can also be found within each visual's directory.
